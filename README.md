# datamininingcapstone
This contains the code and reports created from Data Mining specialization capstone project. 
The final report - Task6_Report was ranked one of the top 10 report by industry experts. 
The final task was to predict Hygiene from given restaurants data set using all the techniques learnt 
during the specialization such as clustering, pattern discovery, text retrieval and search engines, 
text mining and analytics and data visualization

There are supporting python and R scripts which were used for researching on different approaches.
Please note that not all the code has been shared given that the some of the ground work for parsing reviews
was provided and Yelp data set was proprietary data.

The goal of the Project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. 
The project will include the following outputs: 

1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.
2. Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.
3. Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.
4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and 
predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.

From the perspective of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds 
of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes 
of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will need to choose a restaurant. 
Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant 
would also be helpful.
